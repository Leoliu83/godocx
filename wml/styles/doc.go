//Styles are predefined sets of paragraph, character, table and numbering properties which can be applied to text. They are stored separately from the document content, which enable them to be managed independently and to be changed in a single location, as opposed to direct formatting which might appear with the content within a document. Each style requires a <w:style> definition within the styles part.
