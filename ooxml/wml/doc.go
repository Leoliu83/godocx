// package wml provides internal structures and functions for working with low-level document elements in GoDocx.
//
// These elements, such as runs, paragraphs, tables, etc., are used internally and are not intended for direct use by end-users.
// End-users will interact with document elements through the higher-level oxml package, which provides a more
// user-friendly interface for creating and manipulating documents.
